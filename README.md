# Vite React Pizza Menu Project

This project is a pizza menu application built using Vite and React. It displays a list of pizza items and allows users to view details about each pizza.
One advantage of Vite is its fast development server and build process, which significantly speeds up the development and hot-reloading experience for web applications.
This is obviously not of essence for a mini project like this one, but this
is a demo project to showcase the use of Vite and React together.
